### About Me
With over 10 years of experience in Neuroscience research and medical education, I have developed a strong skill set in curriculum design, lecturing, and statistical analysis. I am now applying my analytical expertise to public health interventions and data analytics, using tools like R, Python and SQL to analyze complex health datasets. I am seeking opportunities where I can apply my unique background to solve meaningful problems in both academic and industry settings.

### üöÄ My Projects

**Childcare Prices Analysis**
> This project analyzes the National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) to uncover trends in childcare costs across the United States from 2008 to 2022. A key focus of this analysis is comparing national and state-level data against the specific trends and data points for the State of Florida. It reveals significant cost increases over time, stark geographic disparities between states, and a notable correlation between local income levels and childcare prices. The project is structured as a series of Jupyter Notebooks (run as Python scripts) that cover data ingestion, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
*   **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Requests, Openpyxl

**Public Health Data Dashboard**
> An interactive dashboard visualizing public health trends for a specific region, built to inform policy-making.
*   **Technologies:** Python (Dash, Plotly), SQL

**Biomedical Literature Analysis**
> A tool that uses NLP to extract and summarize findings from a large corpus of biomedical research papers.
*   **Technologies:** Python (NLTK, spaCy), R
